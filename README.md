# Story-generator
This program generates random stories

To generate your own story from the context-free grammar, run `perl cfg.pl`

Here is an example story:

This clever piano studies. A big robot greets some clever spies. The robot cries. This purple spy cries. The mean robot laughs. A cat likes the mean robot. These mean cakes hit a cake. This mean spy laughs. A mean robot cries. The cakes ski.

To generate a story with consistent characters, run `perl character.test.pl`

Here is an example story:

A silly happy spy does nothing.  The spy likes a shiny metal robot. The robot is happy.  The robot watches the spy.  The spy jumps over the robot.  The robot smiles.  A kind happy duck greets the robot.  The robot eats the duck. The duck is dead.
